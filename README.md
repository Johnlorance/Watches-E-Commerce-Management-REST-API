# Watches-E-Commerce-Management-REST-API
It’s our pleasure to introduce Tick to the future API. The Watches E-Commerce Management REST API is a comprehensive solution designed to efficiently manage the essential components of an e-commerce platform, specifically focusing on watches, customers, orders, and order shipments. This API enables seamless CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations with advanced features such as bulk actions, soft deletes, and flexible search capabilities. The system ensures secure access by integrating JWT-based authentication and authorization, while robust exception handling provides informative responses to clients. Non-functional requirements, including logging, rate limiting, and clean architecture, enhance the API’s performance and reliability. This project is designed to simulate real-world business logic, ensuring that order processing adheres to inventory constraints and maintains consistency throughout the system.
